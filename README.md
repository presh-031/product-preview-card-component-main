### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Mobile-first workflow seems to make things easier, leading to the same result with less code.
- Thinking responsively, with relative units.
- Practical applications of media queries
- Little bit of css grid and flexbox revision, as i used them interchangeably in this project.

### Continued development

The plan is to continue working on more projects that emphasize responsiveness, with mobile-first workflow.

### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/media-query-css-example-max-and-min-screen-width-for-mobile-responsive-design/) - This helped me with media queries syntax and the various device widths.
